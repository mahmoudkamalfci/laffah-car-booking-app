I want to create a profile menu for my app. The menu should have the following features:
- avater of first character of name
- name
- phone number
- إعدادات الحساب
- حجوزاتى
- تسجيل الخروج

the design should be exactly the same as the image here prompts/profile-menu.png

the menu should be openable from the top left corner of the screen
you have to use shadecn ui menu component. 
also you have to check global.css file for the design tokens

the menu should be openable from the top left corner of the screen
for now mark user as logged in to show the menu in navbar component 

the menu should be closedable by clicking outside of it.
install component using pnpm using this command 
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add dropdown-menu
